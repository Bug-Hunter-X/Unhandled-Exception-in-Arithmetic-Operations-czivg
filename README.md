This repository contains a JavaScript code example demonstrating basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and error handling for division by zero.  The example showcases a potential error in exception handling that could lead to unexpected behavior in a production environment. The solution demonstrates improved error handling.
